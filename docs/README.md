## Things To Look Into To

Got odd message when running `git push`. Check on what this means:

```sh
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '140.82.113.4' to the list of known hosts.
```

```bash
npm WARN lifecycle The node binary used for scripts is /var/folders/2c/1dnbncws3t7cjs3rw1zpkdj40000gn/T/yarn--1563442289788-0.24791787254492803/node but npm is using /Users/davidroyer/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.0/bin/node itself. Use the `--scripts-prepend-node-path` option to include the path for the node binary npm was executed with.
```
