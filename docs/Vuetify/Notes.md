# Notes

- **IMPORTANT:** key to customizing with SASS Variables is shown below:

```scss
$material-light: (
  // cards: blue,
    text: (
      primary: #2c3e50
    )
);
```

- This Vuetify Vuepress theme is a great resource for this project.
  Especially helpful for looking up SASS variable names.

- Need to start using the new typography classes of like `text-h1`. They make a
  lot more sense and the originals will be depreciated at some point probably.

- [This file](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/blob/master/packages/vuetify/src/styles/settings/_light.scss) is key to setting up customizations for styles.
