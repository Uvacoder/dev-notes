# SASS Variables & Customization

- The key is to use the file reference within the DevTools that shoes where the
  styles are coming from. You realized this when trying to adjust the `code` styles.

- For customizing SASS variables, you **don't** need to import anything from
  Vuetify like mentioned in the docs.  
  I believe this is because the Nuxt/Vuetify module is handling it but I still
  need to look into this.
